# Shopping-Cart-Exercise
I have expanded upon this code base for my project at MIT xPRO. We used React to create a front end shopping cart, and made a call use doFetch to call to the backend of Strapi API. This was my first experience with backend and I am enjoying it this far, excited to expand on this project later to add more styles and functionality.
